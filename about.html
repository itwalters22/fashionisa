	<h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
	<p>Hi guys! Thank you for visiting my blog! My name is Isa, and I am a sophomore at Tufts University near Boston, MA, but I’m originally from North Carolina. I am currently studying Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science, which means I am super interested in how humans experience the online world. Fun fact: I actually coded this website completely from scratch! A little bit more about me: I love thrifting, tap dancing, dogs, and I am seriously addicted to bubble tea.

	<h1><span>The Story of Fashionisa</span></h1>
	<p>Throughout my life I’ve used fashion as a creative outlet to express myself, whether it be dressing up to go out of the house, or sewing and designing clothes. During quarantine 2020, I realized I had lost this creative outlet since I had to stay home in my pajamas every day. Shortly after this realization, I started thinking of ways I could still express myself and perhaps inspire others while doing so. Thus, my blog was born. My main goal in writing this blog is to openly reflect on how I’m staying healthy, being creative, and keeping busy during quarantine. Ideally, my fashion inspiration and lifestyle tips will empower you to build and take care of yourselves no matter what situation you are in right now. Thank you guys so much for visiting my blog, and I hope that you’ll join me on this journey to becoming happier, healthier, and more empowered through 2020 and beyond! </p>

I’m super friendly and I love to meet new people, so don’t be afraid to reach out! :)</p>
